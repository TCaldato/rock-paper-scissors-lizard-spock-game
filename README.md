#### Development

The game was designed to provide entertainment for users of all ages, from children to the elderly. It was created to be easy to understand and play, allowing users to enjoy it alone or compete with others using the game's score.

#### Target Audience

  - Current users
  - New users

#### Structure

- The game was organized in one page:

![Game Page](assets/images/readme/allpage.jpg)

- The Main Page is separated into three parts:

    1. The Header, with the Title of the Game and the Game Score;
    2. The Body, with the five choices for the user;
    3. The Footer, with the game rules.

- When a user selects an option on the main page to play against the computer, it opens, with JavaScript, a overlapping information where they can see if they have won or lost the game:

### Design

#### Color Scheme

- The color scheme was chosen with the idea of fun in mind. The colors of the card game are bright and vivid, conveying a message of energy, enthusiasm, and fun. However, the background color is a shade of blue that covers most of the screen, providing a sense of calm and softness. This prevents the user from feeling tired even after playing for extended periods of time.

#### Typography

- The typography pairing used on the site is [Indie Flower](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Indie+Flower), imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). In case the import fails, there is a backup of the Sans-Serif available.

- **The Primary Content**

  - The primary content consists of five cards containing GIFs that display the user's available choices. The options include Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock.

- **Features Left to Implement**

  - **Play the Game with an online friend:**
    - Feature - Provide the user with the choice to play with an online friend rather than solely with the computer.
