#### Scoreboard

- The scoreboard will add points for both the computer and user, but will not change the score if it is a tie. The game will end when either the computer or user reaches 5 points, and the color of the scoreboard will change accordingly. If the user wins, the score will turn green, and if the computer wins, the score will turn red. No issues were found:

## User Testing

My husband, my Brother and my Mentor Seun were asked to review the game to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues. Their helpful advice throughout the process led to a few small UX changes in order to create a better experience.
